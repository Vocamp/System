# System
Several models were discused and follow ups on chem system and perhaps landforms are anticipated.
One follow up is a general System model developed by Gary Berg-Cross to help advance further work.
Both graphic and more formal ODP models were developed with some initial documentation of Systems, their behavior via mechnaims and interating components.
It is expected that more specific and supportinng patterns will be developed and available in 2020.
